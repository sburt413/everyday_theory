            Code has or supports one of two roles:
It adds value to your business It&amp;rsquo;s the code that drives the prior bullet point The first bullet point is usually called service code. It&amp;rsquo;s the service your company is being paid to do. The second bullet point can be one of many things, it could be controllers/webapps/etc. It can be chron jobs that perform various functions. It&amp;rsquo;s the code for how people interact with the system.

Thoughts I want the number and density/complexity of thoughts to be the primary measure people think about a function. Now, there&amp;rsquo;s still cyclomatic complexity, which is a valid metric.
