            Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s what you don&amp;rsquo;t say that hurts you the most. Let&amp;rsquo;s go.
Side Effects A warning before we begin, I will use the words &amp;ldquo;side effects&amp;rdquo; heavily in this post. I come at this from the functional school of thought. Quite honestly, in said school of thought, &amp;ldquo;side&amp;rdquo; effects can be the very necessary things your system does. Writing to a database is technically a side effect. If something happens in the system outside the expected return value.

            Code has one of two roles:
Add value to your business Drive the prior bullet point The first bullet point is usually called service code. It&amp;rsquo;s the service your company is being paid to do. The second bullet point can be one of many things, it could be controllers/webapps/etc. It can be cron jobs that perform various functions. It&amp;rsquo;s the code for how people interact with the system. Their functionality is usually described in the &amp;lsquo;Use Case&amp;rsquo; field of the Jira ticket.

            I&amp;rsquo;ve seen multiple criticisms of Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s Clean Code involving the (short) length of functions. I&amp;rsquo;ve also seen multiple great responses to those rules of thumb. I want to derive another way to reason about the length of a function. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.
Thoughts I want the number and density/complexity of thoughts to be the primary measure people think about a function. Now, there&amp;rsquo;s still cyclomatic complexity, which is a valid metric.
