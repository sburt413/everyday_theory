            Chess has a long history of structured openings. You have a set of steps that put you in a certain position, with known strengths and weaknesses. You basically start the actual game several moves in. From the opening, you have several options to branch out from.
There is also a common nomenclature. If I say, &amp;ldquo;Queen&amp;rsquo;s Gambit&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; honestly most people will think of the Netflix series. In reality, the term does refer to an actual opening that a chess expert should be able to visualize from just the name alone.
